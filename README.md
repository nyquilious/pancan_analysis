# Pancreatic Cancer Analysis of Metastatic Indicator Genes

# Using a database of bulk-RNAseq data from METAGX, I characterize findings that predict clinical N1M1 characterization of pancreatic tumors. Namely, the goal of this study is to characerize how the tumor microenvironment changes throughout tumor timecourse which could be useful for prognostic efficiency. This gene scraping was done using random forest, boosting, decision trees, some attempts with simple vector machines, and penalized regression models.
